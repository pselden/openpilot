# Odyssey build: how it's tested

Everything here runs on a PC (Ubuntu 24.04, or WSL2 on Windows). Nothing in this folder runs on the comma.
A change goes onto the comma only after every layer below passes. Then it gets a few real drives, and those drives go through the drive report.

| Layer | Script | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| 0. **Pre-push checklist** | `prepush.sh [--full]` | Runs everything below that fits in a few minutes, plus the checks the layers miss. Required before every push to `ody-next` / `ody-test` |
| 1. opendbc suite | `opendbc_test.sh [branch]` | Panda safety C tests, MISRA, lint, and every car test, including `test_odyssey_port.py` |
| 2. Full build | `build_pc.sh [branch]` | The whole tree compiles. Prints the Honda tuning it builds (delay, ki) |
| 3. A/B replay | `replay_ab.sh [base]` | Replays comma's Honda test routes on a sunnypilot base and on this build. Every difference must trace to a deliberate change |
| 4. Own-route replay | `replay_segments.py <segment>` | card and controlsd from this build run cleanly on my own Odyssey drives |
| 5. Van model + sims | `fit_plant.py`, opendbc `odyssey_load_sim.py` | Closed-loop check of gas changes against a van model fitted from real drives |
| 6. Freshness | `freshness.sh` | How far behind comma, sunnypilot, MVL and brikowski this build is |
| 7. Drive report | `drive_report/` | What actually happened on the road |

## 0. Pre-push checklist

```bash
tools/ody/prepush.sh            # ~90 s: build, models on PC, scans, tests, Honda car + safety, own-drive replay, pins, release bump
tools/ody/prepush.sh --full     # + opendbc's whole suite and the A/B replay
```

What it checks, and why:

- **model_store:** checks the live catalog selector version and samples a TSFDOM artifact header for the plain-artifact format. This catches catalog/format mismatches; it does not prove full inference or on-device timing. Prints WARN when offline.
- **turn_lane_change:** replays DesireHelper over recorded routes, comparing lane changes started in turns and genuine lane-change episodes with the recorded build. Needs sufficiently long local rlogs. `drive_report/lane_change_check.py` reports the recorded episodes separately.
- **models:** loads and runs the stock driving model and driver monitoring through their real entry points (`checks/model_e2e.py`). No unit test starts these processes. In October 2026 a tinygrad pin that didn't match comma's model code crashed driver monitoring on the device and blocked onboarding. With that pin put back, this check fails.
- **imports / params / services:** static scans (`checks/`) for imports of modules or names that no longer exist, params keys that aren't registered, and SubMaster/PubMaster services cereal doesn't know. Upstream merges break all three silently.
- **pytest:** openpilot + sunnypilot unit and UI tests. Three locationd/calibrationd scenario tests are deselected because they assert comma's thresholds, which MVL widened on purpose for mount tolerance.
- **locationd_gps:** sunnypilot's `test_params_gps` waits a fixed 5 s for a param, so it runs alone after the parallel step. Prepush first waits up to 60 s for the load average to drop, then retries with a pause. It passes 10/10 on a quiet machine but failed 3 back-to-back retries right after the parallel run.
- **settings_ui:** builds the comma four settings home and every settings group offscreen and renders each onto one wide canvas (`checks/settings_render.py`, PNGs in the prepush log dir). Unit tests never build these pages.
- **honda_car / honda_safety:** opendbc's Honda car tests (including `test_odyssey_port.py`) and panda safety tests.
- **honda_car_parallel:** the same car tests split across workers. The Odyssey `get_params` sets class-level `CarControllerParams` values, so a test can pass serially only because an earlier test built Odyssey params in the same process. A downhill test did exactly that from Atlanta through Buckhead.
- **replay:** card + controlsd from this build on a recorded Odyssey segment (`--rlogs DIR`, default `Documents\openpilot\rlogs`).
- **pins (informational):** whether our tinygrad contains the pin comma master expects, and how msgq/rednose/panda compare.
- **release_audit:** compares with the published branch (`checks/release_audit.py`). Fails if a params key changed type, and lists every reader of that key. Fails on any commit authored as `root` in openpilot or in the opendbc pin range. Warns about params keys added or removed.
- **release bump (warning):** a push should carry the next codename in `BUILD_NAME` and today's date as the version.

## Setup (once)

```bash
# Windows: wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
tools/ody/build_pc.sh ody-next          # clones to ~/odynext and builds (first run ~15 min, rebuilds ~2 min)
cd ~/odynext && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Logs come off the comma with `pull_comma_logs.ps1` on the laptop, which copies `rlog.zst` and `qlog.zst` for every segment into `Documents\openpilot\rlogs\<route>--<seg>\`. The stock uploader only sends qlogs, so full rlogs have to come this way. From WSL that folder is `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/Documents/openpilot/rlogs`.

## 1. opendbc suite

```bash
tools/ody/opendbc_test.sh ody-next      # or ody-test
```

This is opendbc's own `test.sh`, about 10,300 tests. The safety tests need the compiled safety library, so they run on Linux only. Two Odyssey-specific points:

- The MVL Honda controller imports `openpilot.common.params`. `opendbc_shim/` stands in for it so opendbc tests run standalone.
- **Mutation check.** After changing the Odyssey safety limits (`max_gas` 2000, `min_gas` -60, `STEER_MAX` 3840, delta 2), loosen one on purpose and confirm the safety tests fail. Then put it back. This proves the tests actually guard the limits.

## 2. Full build

`build_pc.sh` builds the whole tree (`scons`, about 80 s on a 20-thread laptop) and then runs `check_params.py`, which prints what this build hands the car:

```
HONDA_ODYSSEY_5G_MMR op long: delay 0.5 ...
```

`check_params.py <segment>` also prints what a recorded drive ran with: fork, branch and delay. This is how the delay mismatch was caught. brikowski's controller is tuned at 0.5 s, MVL sets 0.25 s for Bosch, and the Odyssey now stays at 0.5 s.

## 3. A/B process replay

```bash
tools/ody/replay_ab.sh                  # base = sunnypilot master; ody-next was checked against PR #2047 (18aa89b49)
```

This builds the base in `~/spbase`, records its outputs on comma's Honda test routes, and replays this build against them. On ody-next every difference traced to one of three changes:

- MVL Honda tuning: ki 0 on Nidec, Bosch delay 0.25.
- brikowski's `longControlState` ordering fix in controlsd.
- The Odyssey controller.

## 4. Replay on my own drives

```bash
python tools/ody/replay_segments.py ~/rlogs/00000008--83edc4fea4--10
```

This runs card and controlsd from this build on a recorded segment. It checks for crashes, valid messages, the fingerprint, the safety param (`hondaBosch` 259), sendcan output, and accel compared with what the car actually ran.

**Known quirk:** the replay harness drops a random number of card frames each run (3 to 725 seen, on any branch). Compare values, not message counts.

## 5. Van model and load sims

```bash
python tools/ody/fit_plant.py ~/rlogs/00000007--509a7563e5--* ~/rlogs/00000008--83edc4fea4--*
```

This fits the van's response to the gas command over engaged, pedal-free samples:

`aEgo(t+0.5) = 0.00111·gas + 0.183 − 0.000345·v² − 0.88·g·sin(pitch)`

The fit uses routes 7 and 8 (empty van, rmse 0.11 m/s²), and its best delay is 0.5 s.

On `ody-test`, `opendbc/car/honda/tests/odyssey_load_sim.py` runs the real Honda CarController in closed loop against this model. It covers each true load against each preset setting, over level pull-aways, 4% climbs and cruise.

To calibrate the load presets: run `fit_plant.py` on a loaded drive and compare `c_gas` and `b` with the empty fit. If needed, update `ODYSSEY_LOAD_FACTORS` and the sim's plant.

## 6. Freshness

```bash
tools/ody/freshness.sh
```

This shows how many upstream commits aren't in this build yet, and lists any MVL branches the fork is missing. The fork mirrors all MVL branches so the built-in branch switcher can reach them.

## 7. Drive report

```bash
python tools/ody/drive_report/extract.py ~/rlogs/00000008--83edc4fea4 /tmp/r8.json
python tools/ody/drive_report/engagements.py /tmp/r8.json   # engagements, why each one ended, events, errors
python tools/ody/drive_report/tracking.py /tmp/r8.json      # accel tracking by request band, gas overrides, lateral error by speed, saturation
python tools/ody/drive_report/uphill.py /tmp/r8.json [...]  # shortfall against grade (the known ~0.2 m/s² uphill gap)

# straight from rlogs, any number of routes (route prefix = rlogs/<route>, without the segment number)
python tools/ody/drive_report/steer_cap_report.py ~/rlogs/<route> [...]     # time at the 2560 steering limit / opened to 3840, by speed band
python tools/ody/drive_report/stop_launch_report.py ~/rlogs/<route> [...]  # Brake Hold, op-long stops and launches
python tools/ody/drive_report/launch_eval.py ~/rlogs/<route> [...]         # where the green-light launch fires and what is in front
```

What to look at after a drive:

- **Long tracking rms.** brikowski ody-op routes ran 0.18 to 0.21.
- **Uphill shortfall.**
- **Steer saturation** and the share of time above 2560 steer counts.
- **Disengage causes.** Brake disengages should be driver choice.
- **Panda TX blocks.** They're benign when they happen only at engage and disengage edges.

## Updating from upstream

1. Run `freshness.sh` to see what's new.
2. Merge, in this order: sunnypilot sync, then MVL dev, then comma master, then brikowski's Odyssey commits.
3. Run layers 1 through 4.
4. Push code only: `GIT_LFS_SKIP_PUSH=1 git push origin <branch>`. In my clone this is the `git push-code` alias. Models come from sunnypilot's Hugging Face store, so they never need to go to GitHub.

## Lessons learned

Add one line each time Q/A finds something new. Turn it into a prepush check when you can.

- **Check submodule pins when taking comma code.** A tinygrad pin that didn't match comma's model code crashed driver monitoring on the device. Covered by `models` and `pins`.
- **Run the processes no unit test starts.** Covered by `models`.
- **After switching branches, run a full `scons`.** Params keys are compiled into `libparams_c.so`, so a stale build fails with UnknownKeyName. Covered by `build`.
- **Run opendbc tests with `PYTHONPATH=$ROOT/opendbc_repo:$ROOT`.** Without it, the venv's installed opendbc is imported and the results mean nothing. Prepush already does this; it matters for hand runs.
- **Tests ported from brikowski can read the wrong constant.** In his tree `CarControllerParams` class values are comma's (gas map floor -0.2). Here they are MVL's (0.0) until the Odyssey `get_params` overwrites them. Ported tests should use the Odyssey constants (`ODYSSEY_GAS_MAP_FLOOR`). Covered by `honda_car_parallel`.
- **Cherry-picks can change a param's type under sunnypilot.** comma #39079 made `LastGPSPosition` binary, and sunnypilot's mapd and map Smart Cruise Control read it as JSON. It was left out of Buckhead SP1. Covered by `release_audit`.
- **Set the git identity in every repo you commit in, including `opendbc_repo`.** Otherwise WSL commits as `root`. Covered by `release_audit`.
- **Timing tests fail under load.** Run them alone after the parallel step, wait for the load to drop, and retry with a pause (`locationd_gps`). Before calling something a regression, alternate 10 runs on old and new commits.
- **Merging comma past sunnypilot's sync can add LFS objects that sunnypilot's store doesn't have.** The 10-12 comma merge brought comma's warp kernels (`big_driving_warp_*_tinygrad.pkl`), and the device installer failed with a 404 on checkout. Those two files are now stored in git. Covered by `lfs_host`.
- **Throwaway worktrees need `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1`.** Otherwise checkout and cherry-pick fail on LFS files from sunnypilot's Hugging Face store.
- **When upstream changes direction, cherry-pick instead of merging.** comma 0.11.3 makes Auto-speed permanent and sunnypilot removed DEC, so the October 16 sync is not merged whole. Before a pick, read its `params_keys.h` and cereal changes.
- **Settings pages only exist once the UI builds them.** Unit tests didn't catch a crash on first render (a `ui_state` attribute that the UI main loop sets at startup). Covered by `settings_ui`. To review a layout, open the PNGs it writes; scrolled screenshots cut cards in half.
- **Settings card labels fit about 9 characters per line next to the icon.** Longer first lines run into the icon; longer second lines get cut to "...". Check the `settings_ui` renders after renaming anything.
- **The `replay` step re-runs card and controlsd, not the planner.** A planner change (like Dahlonega's green-light launch) gets no replay coverage; run it over recorded drives offline (`drive_report/launch_eval.py`) to see where it fires and what is in front.
- **Check upstream fixes against your own drives before porting.** Dahlonega dropped two of three candidates that way (stops were already gentle; Brake Hold never turned on). `drive_report/stop_launch_report.py` does that check.
