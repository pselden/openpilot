# OdyPilot: sunnypilot for the Honda Odyssey

**OdyPilot** is Paul Selden's personal Odyssey build, based on
[Patrick Rehkopf's ody-test](https://github.com/prehkopf/openpilot/tree/ody-test).
It preserves that branch's Odyssey controls and adds the TSFDOM loader fixes and
brikowski's Odyssey startup artwork. Credit for the base driving software belongs
to Patrick, brikowski, MVL, sunnypilot, and comma.ai.

Install: `installer.comma.ai/pselden/ody-test`.

MVL's Honda cluster HUD changes retain a valid previous set speed while ACC is off
and show MADS armed/lateral-active states through the lane indicators. These are
instrument-cluster changes, separate from the comma display. The vehicle-code pin
uses [pselden/opendbc](https://github.com/pselden/opendbc/tree/codex-odyssey-hud),
based on Patrick's existing Odyssey tune with only these HUD changes added.

The application animation updates with the branch. Optional early-boot helper
code is included for completeness but is not installed or run automatically; see
[the boot-theme guide](docs/odypilot-boot.md).

## Branches

`ody-test` is maintained in [pselden/openpilot](https://github.com/pselden/openpilot/tree/ody-test).
The branch picker identifies this fork as OdyPilot and retains access to the
Patrick, MVL, brikowski, sunnypilot, and comma forks.

## Inherited Patrick Rehkopf releases

Each release is named after a place in Georgia, A to Z, and versioned by its release date (`YYYY.MM.DD`, with `.2`, `.3` for later releases the same day). The comma shows the name on the home screen and startup banner, for example "Buckhead • 5c3aa0d", and shows a short "what's new" card after an update.

### Etowah (2026.10.18.6): on `ody-test`

Dahlonega plus navigation without comma prime (navigation step 1).

- **comma's navigation works without prime.** comma brought back navigation as "nav alpha" on 2026-10-11 (#39066), but without prime comma's servers refuse both routes and map tiles (403). This build gets them elsewhere:
  - **Routes** come from your own free Mapbox token (100,000 requests a month free), kept on the comma and never backed up.
  - **The map** comes from an offline OpenStreetMap file on the comma (the Protomaps basemap; Georgia is 848 MB), so it works without internet.
  - The comma four shows the next turn, the distance to it, a small map, and the ETA.
- **Destination picker** in settings → driving, second after van load. It lists your saved places, which are stored only on the comma. Picking one starts the route and turns navigation on, and the route clears when the car turns off. It's meant for openpilot's route awareness; keep the phone for traffic rerouting.
- **Privacy fixes in comma's navd:**
  - A failed route request no longer logs the request URL, which contained the access token.
  - Route logs no longer include coordinates. Logs upload to comma.
- **Bug fix:** map tiles crashed on sunnypilot's API helper (no `dongle_id`).
- Setup on the comma (token, places, map file) is a one-time script, `qa/nav_setup.sh` in my notes. Nothing personal is in this repo.

### Dahlonega (2026.10.18.5)

Chattahoochee plus a quicker launch from a stop.

- **Green-light launch.** From a stop, the driving model's plan creeps before it commits to moving. Once it plans to be past 2 m/s (4.5 mph) within 3.5 s, openpilot takes the acceleration from the part of the plan where it is already moving: up to 1.5 m/s², fading out by 2 m/s. It never overrides the car ahead: the planner still takes the lowest of the model, lead-following and cruise targets. Ported from comma's unmerged `better-green-lights` branch, gated on Dynamic Experimental Control's model mode.
  - On my drives the plan asked for only 0.13-0.29 m/s² in the second before moving; this asks for 1.44-1.50. Across all 16 pulled drives it would have fired only at the 3 launches with openpilot longitudinal, 7.2 s in total.
- **MADS brake-pause fix** (sunnypilot PR #2031): with steering-on-brake set to Pause, holding the brake from before MADS engaged no longer ends in "take control immediately".
- **Checked and left out:**
  - comma's gentler final-stop ramp (#38658): my 4 openpilot stops already ended gently (-0.06 to -0.27 m/s²).
  - sunnypilot's Honda Brake Hold disengage (#2039): Brake Hold never turned on in 16 drives.

### Chattahoochee (2026.10.18.4)

Buckhead SP1 plus a reorganized settings menu on the comma four.

- **Settings in five groups, most-used first:** driving, software, screen & alerts, privacy, system. Before, options were spread over Toggles, Device, Developer, Software and the sunnylink web app.
- **Driving** starts with **van load**, then personality, Dynamic Experimental Control, lane change, Experimental mode, MADS and enable OdyPilot.
- **MADS on/off and lane change mode** (nudge, nudgeless, 0.5-3 s, off) can now be changed on the comma. Before, only the sunnylink web app had them. MADS only changes with the car off, as in sunnypilot.
- Van load and onroad screen moved off the Device page, so nothing appears twice. The metric units button is gone (the setting stays at mph).
- **Software** holds updates & branch, models and sunnylink. **System** holds device, network, developer and firehose. Pairing still opens straight to the pairing card.
- **Testing:** new tests fail if a stock toggle is lost or appears in two groups. The pre-push checklist now builds and renders every settings page.

### Buckhead SP1 (2026.10.18.3)

A service pack: Buckhead plus fixes picked from upstream on 2026-10-18.

- **More gas when the van needs it** (brikowski 6d4b34f8, from his 2026-10-13 stable release). The gas feedback can now use all the gas headroom the map leaves, not just a fixed amount. This should help on hills and pull-aways.
- **No duplicate MADS "can't engage" alerts** (sunnypilot #1949).
- **Smoother steering on engage.** The model starts from the previous curvature while steering is off (comma #39091).
- **GPS startup fixes** (comma #39071, #39083). comma #39079 (start from the last GPS position) is left out: it stores LastGPSPosition in a binary format that sunnypilot's map features (map Smart Cruise Control, map speed limits) cannot read.
- **Steadier timing after a hiccup.** Control loops resync after a stall instead of running catch-up frames (comma #39095).
- **Offroad alert when uploads are being ignored** (comma #39104).
- **Not taken on purpose:** comma 0.11.3 makes Experimental mode ("Auto-speed") permanent and removes Chill mode, and sunnypilot then removed Dynamic Experimental Control. OdyPilot keeps DEC.
- **Tests:** an Odyssey downhill test now checks against the Odyssey's own gas-map floor (-0.2) instead of MVL's generic Bosch value.

### Buckhead (2026.10.18.2)

- **Turn vs lane change.** With the blinker on, braking in the last 2 seconds means a turn, not a lane change, so turning the wheel no longer starts a lane change. On replays of my drives, lane changes started at intersections dropped from 19 to 9, and all 12 real lane changes still worked.
- **Status pills** on the comma four: following gap to the car ahead (seconds while moving, feet when stopped), the van load setting, and why Dynamic Experimental Control switched to Experimental (`STOP AHEAD`, `SLOWING`, `CURVE`, `STOPPED`, `COLLISION`).
- **Steering-wheel bookmark.** Double-tap CANCEL to save a bookmark with a chime, so the moment is easy to find in the logs later without reaching for the screen.
- **Dim at night.** An onroad screen option that follows the light down to 10% brightness.
- **Settings profile.** My chosen settings are re-applied after a reinstall or a sunnylink restore (alpha longitudinal, DEC, personality, MADS, screen, updates on).
- **"What's new" card** after an update.
- **Branch switcher: pick the fork, then the branch** (OdyPilot, Patrick, MVL, brikowski, sunnypilot, comma). It only offers branches that exist, and warns before a one-way switch to another fork.
- **Pre-push checklist** (`tools/ody/prepush.sh`) run before every release.
- **Bug fixes & improvements.** sunnylink settings sync no longer drops a text setting the web app sends unencoded.

### Atlanta (2026.10.17): on `ody-next`

- **Status pills** on the comma four: `OP LONG` / `STOCK ACC` and `EXP` / `DEC•EXP` / `DEC•ACC`.
- **Dynamic Experimental Control toggle** on the comma four.
- Release codenames and release-date versions.
- **Model runtime fix.** tinygrad is pinned to a version that contains comma's pin, so driver monitoring and the driving model load on the device. Without it, setup stuck on "looking for driver".
- OdyPilot branding: home screen, boot logo, startup banner and screensaver.

## Roadmap

These are plans in rough order, not promises. Anything that changes how the van drives waits for enough drive data to tune it and to check the result. Last updated 2026-10-18.

**Next releases**
- **Fayette**
  - Uphill compensation. Holds and gentle slowdowns run about 0.2 m/s² short on grades over 1°.
  - Smarter DEC on the highway: stay in ACC above about 55 mph unless the model sees a stop. Needs some highway time with DEC on first.
  - Tune the green-light launch from real launches. Dahlonega asks for up to 1.5 m/s²; lower it if it feels abrupt.
  - The comma stays awake 1 hour after a drive instead of 30 hours, to spare the van battery.
- **Gwinnett**
  - Exit slowdown (navigation step 2): slow only for the off-ramp you're taking, never for on-ramps, and not before the ramp splits from the highway. The signal is the comma's route when you're on it, and otherwise your right blinker plus the ramp in the offline map. That way it works when you follow Google Maps instead.
  - Learned behavior kept between drives, stored separately for each van load.
  - Van load that suggests itself from how the van accelerates, offered as a pill rather than switched silently.

**Later**
- A "Georgia traffic" personality: shorter gap at speed, quicker catch-up when the car ahead pulls away, earlier resume.
- Gentler braking and a longer gap when the wipers are on.
- Acceleration personality (Sport / Normal / Eco), from sunnypilot's draft #815.
- Lane change: a nudge can override the road-edge block, from sunnypilot #2049.
- Update download progress shown as a percentage instead of a fixed "downloading...". `ody-test` first, with tests, because a broken updater can strand the device.
- Fold in brikowski's newer Odyssey commits as he publishes them to his stable branch (ECON mode, gas at the feedforward floor, drivetrain changes, speed calibration).

**Investigating**
- An emergency-braking layer to partly make up for the stock collision braking that openpilot longitudinal turns off. `ody-test` only, with safety tests.
- Slowing for exit ramps from map data, on off-ramps only, never before the ramp splits off.
- Handling remote start cleanly.
- Low-speed steering: let the steering gate open below 34 mph on a test branch (see [Steering limits](#steering-limits-odyssey)). This could also simply go to brikowski, since the gate is his.

**Watching upstream**
- comma's opendbc #3165 keeps openpilot accelerating while you press the gas. It changes panda safety for every brand and has no reviews yet, so it waits for comma to merge it.
- comma #39105 would revert AccelBoost (gas taps add a little acceleration in Experimental mode), which this build has. It stays until comma explains the revert.
- comma's experiments with MADS on openpilot longitudinal (`mads`, `mads2`), calibration hysteresis (#39108), and sunnypilot's detailed onroad view for the comma four (#1767).
- comma's opendbc cleanups (remove car mass, remove rear steer ratio), once sunnypilot's next sync carries them.

**Decided against, for now**
- comma 0.11.3's permanent Auto-speed. comma removed Chill mode and sunnypilot removed DEC; this build keeps Dynamic Experimental Control and takes upstream fixes by cherry-pick.
- A gentler final stop (comma #38658, sunnypilot #2034): openpilot stops on my drives already end gently.
- Disengaging on Honda Brake Hold (sunnypilot #2039): Brake Hold never turned on in 16 drives.
- Bookmark on a distance-button hold: that hold already toggles Experimental mode in sunnypilot. The bookmark stays on double-tap CANCEL, which also cancels cruise.
- Speed-limit-based set speed, trip mode, and an automatic post-drive email (on hold until the garage Wi-Fi is better).

## What's in `ody-next`

The branch is built in this order:

1. sunnypilot's October 2026 comma sync (comma openpilot 2026-10-07).
2. MVL `sp-honda-dev-202608`.
3. comma master 2026-10-11.
4. brikowski's Odyssey controller and fixes, through his 2026-10-12 commits.

Odyssey-specific details:

- **Longitudinal.** brikowski's controller replaces the generic Honda Bosch gas and wind learner for the Odyssey only. Every other Honda keeps MVL's behavior.
- **Actuator delay is 0.5 s** on the Odyssey. brikowski's controller is tuned at 0.5 s. MVL uses 0.25 s for Bosch, but a fit of my own drives also puts the van at 0.5 s.
- **Steering.** STEER_MAX is 3840 with delta 2, behind brikowski's steering-authority gate (normally 2560); see [Steering limits](#steering-limits-odyssey). Platform flags are `BOSCH_ALT_BRAKE | BOSCH_ALT_RADAR` (safetyParam 259).
- **Experimental mode.** Gas taps add a small, temporary acceleration boost (comma's AccelBoost). This works with Dynamic Experimental Control.
- **comma four screen.** An "onroad screen" picker on the Device page: always on, 15 s or 3 min (Buckhead adds dim at night).
- **Kept from comma:** the block on openpilot sending AEB. Stock emergency braking is not available with openpilot longitudinal on Bosch Hondas. openpilot's forward collision warning and hard braking still work.

## Steering limits (Odyssey)

Short version: this build steers with less top-end torque than MVL's on purpose. It stays in the range where the Odyssey's steering responds cleanly, and opens more only when the van is clearly missing a curve.

| | Normal limit | Highest limit | Torque rise per frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| comma (opendbc, 2026-10) | 2560 | 2560 | 3 |
| MVL `sp-honda-dev-202608` | 4096 | 4096 | 3 |
| This build (brikowski's controller) | 2560 | 3840 | 2 |

- comma's opendbc caps the Odyssey MMR at 2560, with the note "Odyssey MMR uses up to 2560 for LKA; higher RDM commands are nonlinear and also apply brake drag." Above 2560 the van treats the command like Road Departure Mitigation: the steering response is no longer proportional, and the brakes drag.
- MVL allows the full 4096 at all times. MVL's own code notes that the top end isn't characterized yet.
- brikowski's gate keeps steering at 2560 normally. It opens to 3840 (6% below MVL's maximum) only at 15-33 m/s (34-74 mph), when the request is already at 2560, the planned curve bends the same way, and the van has been more than 0.10 m/s² short of it for 0.2 s.
- On my drives (99 minutes of hands-off steering, October 2026):
  - Under 34 mph, steering sat at the 2560 limit 9.8% of the time, running a median 0.17 m/s² wide of the planned curve while limited.
  - At 34-55 mph it was at the limit 3.7% of the time, and the gate opened past 2560 for 76 seconds in total.
  - Above 55 mph it was under 1%.
  - So the gate mostly matters in town, where it never opens. Above 34 mph it does its job.
- The script is `tools/ody/drive_report/steer_cap_report.py`. A possible next step is a test branch that lets the gate open below 34 mph, watching for steering faults and brake drag. That decision is shared with brikowski.

## Testing

Every release passes the pre-push checklist (`tools/ody/prepush.sh`): a full PC build, the driving and driver-monitoring models loaded and run on the PC, code scans, the openpilot and sunnypilot unit and UI tests, the Honda car and safety tests, and a replay of a recorded Odyssey drive. Changes to car code also pass opendbc's full suite (panda safety, MISRA, about 10,300 car tests) and process replay against a sunnypilot base. Driving changes are replayed against my own Odyssey drives before they go in the van. The methods and scripts are in [`tools/ody/`](tools/ody/README.md).

## ⚠️ Read this first

- This is a personal build, tested on one 2022 Odyssey with a comma four. brikowski develops on a 2023, but I haven't driven any other year on this build.
- openpilot longitudinal on Bosch Hondas is **alpha**. It disables the stock radar, and with it stock ACC and collision mitigation braking.
- You are the driver. Keep your hands ready and your eyes on the road.
