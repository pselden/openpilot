"""OdyPilot: factory mode, a stock Odyssey for other drivers. In Park, hold CANCEL for 3 s to switch.

Factory mode starts the drive passive (the same path as the "enable OdyPilot" toggle off): the panda stays in
no-output safety, so the harness relay hands the car back to the stock camera, and the radar is never silenced,
so stock ACC, LKAS and collision mitigation work. The switch only takes effect at the next start because the radar
is silenced once per ignition cycle and can't be woken cleanly mid-drive.

openpilotLongitudinalControl stays set in factory mode, so selfdrived and the UI don't clear ExperimentalMode or
DynamicExperimentalControl, and OdyPilot comes back with the same settings.
