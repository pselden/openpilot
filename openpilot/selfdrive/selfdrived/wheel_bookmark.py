"""OdyPilot: double-tap CANCEL on the steering wheel to bookmark the drive.

msgq allows one publisher per service and the UI owns userBookmark, so selfdrived only counts double-taps
(selfdriveStateSP.wheelBookmarkCount) and the UI publishes the bookmark, the same way as the onroad swipe.
CANCEL is used because a single tap only ends openpilot longitudinal (steering stays on with MADS), and it is
pressed rarely in normal driving, unlike +/- (double-tapped to change speed) or distance (cycles personality).
