"""OdyPilot: green-light launch, ported from comma's better-green-lights branch (2026-07, not merged upstream).

From a stop, the driving model's plan starts with a slow creep before it commits to moving. Once the model plans to
be past LAUNCH_DISARM_SPEED by LAUNCH_COMMIT_T, skip ahead to the part of its plan where it is already moving and
take that acceleration instead, capped at LAUNCH_MAX_ACCEL and fading out by LAUNCH_DISARM_SPEED. It only ever raises
the model (e2e) candidate; the planner still takes the minimum with the lead-following MPC and cruise targets.

Differences from comma's version: gated on the DEC-aware is_e2e (DEC hands the model control at a stop), and the
model plan is interpolated here because this planner does not parse it.
On the 2026-10 Odyssey drives the plan asked 0.13-0.29 m/s^2 in the second before moving; this asks 1.44-1.50.
